    <p>Jamshedjii Nusserwanji Tata was born in 1839. Tata graduated from Elphinstone College in Bombay in 1858. Shortly afterwards, he joined his father’s trading firm that dealt in general merchandise. There, the junior Tata took a special When the American Civil War caused a boom in the Bombay cotton market, Tata and his father joined the Asiatic Banking Corporation. When the tide ebbed, Tata's credit was left desolate. Fortunately, the firm’s credit was re-established during the next three years. A share in the lucrative contract for the commissariat of Napier’s expedition to Abyssinia in 1868 restored the family fortune.” In 1870 with Rs.21,000 capital, he founded a trading company.[14] Further, he bought a bankrupt oil mill at Chinchpokli and converted it into a cotton mill, under the name Alexandra Mill which he sold for a profit after two years. In 1874, he set up another cotton mill at Nagpur named Empress Mill. He dreamed of achieving four goals, setting up an iron and steel company, a unique hotel, a world-class learning institution, and a hydroelectric plant. During his lifetime, in 1903, the Taj Mahal Hotel at Colaba waterfront was opened making it the first hotel with electricity in British India.

        1904–1938
        After Jamsetji's death, his older son Dorabji Tata became the chairman in 1904.[14] Sir Dorabji established the Tata Iron and Steel Company (TISCO), now known as Tata Steel in 1907. Marking the group's global ambitions, Tata Limited opened its first overseas office in London. Following the founder's goals, Western India's first hydro plant was brought to life, giving birth to Tata Power. Yet another dream, Indian Institute of Science was established with the first group of students admitted in 1911.</p>
        <h2>Work at company</h2>
        <P>Mistry pressed companies to focus on improving the efficiency of boards, pushing for a performance-oriented culture. He created parallel teams and structures with the freedom to challenge and break hierarchical structures, according to Tata insiders.

            He has shone a light on critical requirements like going digital and being agile, and has clearly placed his finger on the right issues, stressing sustainable, profitable growth."
            Mistry had spent the first three years understanding the sprawling Tata empire and its complexities. Half a dozen Tata insiders say he has been building knowledge about specific domains to ask the right questions and understanding geopolitics, technology and societal issues.

Mistry often attended classrooms that have professors and academicians sharing knowledge. He recently attended a digital marketing session addressed by Facebook executives and conducted by Harvard University.

            <h1>About the Team</h1>
            <p>There must be an effective channel of communication(or Organizational communication) from the top to the bottom of the chain of command and vice versa. An effective channel of communication will allow messages to be transferred accurately without delay to the intended recipient, which will speed up decision making processes and the operations of the team. Furthermore, effective communication will increase the flexibility of an organization and cause it to be less susceptible to changes in the external environment, as a faster decision making process will allow organizations a longer time period to adapt to the changes and execute contingency plans.[3] The use of social media at work positively influences three team processes, specifically the effective communication, knowledge sharing and coordination.[4]</p>
